- Conclusions:
    * {typeof(T).IsInstanceOfType(target)} is much slower than {target is T} (the former not presented)

    * Checking type via {target is T} makes up  contributes ~5% of the fastest implementation to date (if-based method selection). 
      Consider removing type check and rely on consumer to supply correct objects or eal with the consequences.

    * Using switch is not faster than dictionary search, even if it seemed that way initially.

    * Selecting methods with a chain of ifs can be faster than either dictionary search or switch,
      depending on number of alternatives we have to check before we land on the right one.
      The time evens out at about 7(?) checks. In this case, with <15 properties to handle,
      average number of checked alternatives will be at 7 or below and average execution time will be on par with dictionary or better.
      Consider using adaptive generation:
        for target types with low number of properties generate if-based implementation;
        for target types with higher no. or properties generate dictionary-based implementation.
      If we could predict how often each particular property will be requested and order the if-statements accordingly, 
      it could significantly improve average times.

    * Notice how Direct value access is twice as fast as Method call 3, which does the same thing 
      and only differs by the need to call 1 method and return its result.
      
    * All in all, the slowest part in all non-reflection implementations is the need to locate appropriate method based on the property field.
      This part makes up the difference between the three full implementations (Dictionary/Switch/If) 
      and Direct method call (or Direct method call 2 once type checks removed from the generated accessors).
      
    * Assuming how expensive it is to locate generated methods, doing so for each property is not optimal in situations when multiple 
      properties need to be processed together (e.g. when updating one object with properties from another one). For those applications
      it will be more effective to generate a method that will process all properties in sequence and call it once.

      Moreover, for situations when a collection of objects needs to be processed in a batch, it will be best to generate a method that accepts 
      the whole collection and loops through it and call it once, than call the same method for each object.
